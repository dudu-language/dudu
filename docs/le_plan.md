# Le Plan

This is the next practical roadmap for Dudu.

Dudu is far enough along to guide development by making real examples easier
instead of planning the whole language in the abstract.

## Engineering Bar

Dudu has moved past throwaway prototype mode. Treat it as a real systems
language project.

Work on this plan should avoid temporary syntax, name-specific imported-library
hacks, string-lowering shortcuts for new language features, and hidden behavior
that cannot be explained as normal Dudu semantics. When a feature needs compiler
architecture first, build the architecture instead of adding a narrow workaround.

The standard is:

- real AST-backed language features
- readable generated C++
- diagnostics that point at Dudu source
- no imported library special cases
- no wrapper-header dependency for normal C/C++ interop
- examples that compile and run
- tests that prove behavior without trapping the dev loop in slow validation
- LSP/editor support that follows the same compiler model

If a planned feature cannot meet that bar yet, document the missing prerequisite
and implement the prerequisite first.

## Feature Validation Bar

Every major language feature should land with both small and realistic Dudu
programs:

- parser/codegen shape fixtures for the simplest form
- negative fixtures for the obvious mistakes and diagnostics
- executable examples for normal use
- at least one real-ish stress example that combines the feature with another
  subsystem or imported C/C++ library when that is the reason the feature
  exists
- fast tests by default, with heavyweight or optional native-library probes kept
  separate from the normal dev loop

Examples of the expected bar:

- generics should cover `clamp[T]`, `Box[T]`, `Vec2[T]`, containers, callbacks,
  and imported C++ algorithm interop
- arrays should cover `array[T][N]`, `array[T][M, N]`, image/matrix kernels,
  inferred literal shapes, swizzling, slicing views, C pointer/span handoff,
  and library tensor indexing hooks
- sum types should cover lexer tokens, UI/game events, network messages,
  recursive expression trees, and exhaustive-match diagnostics
- inheritance should cover simple bases, abstract contracts, partial abstract
  bases, multiple interface-like bases, `super`, imported C++ bases, and an
  autograd-style graph
- macro prerequisites should include serde-like derives, binary serialization,
  reflection metadata, generated tests, and export-table generation as target
  examples

## 1. Finish The Project Driver

Primary plan: [Dudu Project Driver Plan](project-driver-plan.md).

Make daily use feel good:

- named targets: done
- `dudu clean`: done
- clean Cargo-ish build logs: done
- `dudu test ./...`: done
- better test binary output paths: done
- examples and docs that prefer `dudu run` where it improves usability: done

This pays off immediately because every future example and feature becomes
easier to build, run, and test.

## 2. Constructors, Destructors, And Operators

Primary plan: [OOP Plan](oop-plan.md).

Related specs:

- [Appearance Spec](appearance-spec.md)
- [Python Subset Compiler Plan](python-subset-compiler-plan.md)

Make the C++ object model feel complete through Python-shaped syntax:

- constructor behavior
- destructor behavior
- overloads
- operator overloads
- member methods
- class-scoped functions
- explicit static fields
- C++ interop behavior for all of the above

Status: constructors, destructors, member methods, imported C++ operator
overloads, Dudu-native operator methods, imported C++ base-method lookup,
`init`/`drop`, class-scoped functions without `@staticmethod`, explicit
`static[T]` fields, and `@operator(...)` are implemented. Broader overload-set
polish remains part of header-awareness hardening.

This is more important than user-defined macros because it directly affects
normal systems and game code.

## 3. Static Members And Namespaced Constants

Related specs:

- [Appearance Spec](appearance-spec.md)
- [Python Subset Compiler Plan](python-subset-compiler-plan.md)

Support class-scoped constants, static data, and static functions.

Status: class-scoped `ALL_CAPS` constants are static constants,
`name: static[T] = value` is mutable class-shared state, and functions inside a
class with no `self` are class-scoped functions. Broader module and namespace
constants remain a candidate if real examples need cleaner organization than
file-level constants.

Python, Rust, C, and C++ all have ways to hang values off a type or namespace.
Dudu needs that so constants and helpers do not all live in the global module
scope.

Target shape:

```python
class Color:
    WHITE: Color = Color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

    r: f32
    g: f32
    b: f32
    a: f32

class Math:
    PI: f64 = 3.141592653589793

    def clamp(x: f32, lo: f32, hi: f32) -> f32:
        if x < lo:
            return lo
        if x > hi:
            return hi
        return x
```

## 4. Harden Native Header Awareness

Primary plan: [Native Header Awareness Plan](header-awareness-plan.md).

The C/C++ interop promise depends on imported headers feeling reliable.

Drive this with real library stress tests:

- raylib
- SDL3
- ImGui
- glm
- sqlite
- POSIX
- C++ standard library containers and utilities

Important areas:

- macros
- templates
- overloads
- namespaces
- inherited C++ classes
- diagnostics when Clang tooling or include paths are wrong

## 5. Polish The Test System

Primary plan: [Dudu Tests](tests.md).

Keep it Cargo-ish.

Short-term fixes:

- `0 tests` output instead of `0/0 tests passed`: done
- unique test binary paths: done
- `dudu test ./...`: done
- `assert expr, "message"`: done

Longer-term features:

- `@test.ignore`: done
- `@test.should_panic`: done
- stdout capture: done
- no-capture mode: done

## 6. Keep Macros And Decorators Conservative

Related specs:

- [Appearance Spec](appearance-spec.md)
- [Python Subset Compiler Plan](python-subset-compiler-plan.md)

Do not build a full user-defined macro system yet.

Do add compiler-recognized decorators when they remove real friction:

- `@test`
- `@inline`
- `@extern_c`
- `@operator`
- target attributes such as `@cuda.global`

User-defined decorators, hygienic macros, and lisp-style compile-time
metaprogramming are separate language design work and should not block the
core C/C++ replacement layer.

## 7. Add Native Inheritance Deliberately

Related docs:

- [Inheritance Plan](inheritance-plan.md)
- [Native Header Awareness Plan](header-awareness-plan.md)
- [Python Subset Compiler Plan](python-subset-compiler-plan.md)

Dudu-native inheritance is now planned, but it should be implemented against the
real AST/type model rather than patched onto string lowering.

For C++ interop, Dudu still needs to consume inherited C++ classes well enough
to:

- call inherited methods: initial imported C++ support is implemented
- construct C++ types that use inheritance: initial imported C++ support is implemented
- pass derived/base pointers and references correctly: initial imported C++ support is implemented

Native inheritance should follow the inheritance plan: method-only `@abstract`,
`@override`, `@virtual`, `super`, strict multiple inheritance, interface-like
abstract classes, and C++-faithful diagnostics.

## Remaining Completion Checklist

These are the remaining practical completion areas for the current language
push. They are not release packaging work.

1. Guard The Development Loop

   Keep validation fast before starting broad compiler rewrites. Split or guard
   slow fixtures, keep optional native-library probes optional, and avoid
   repeatedly running heavyweight tests while iterating on parser/sema changes.

   Status: the `std_vector_map_string` codegen-shape hang is fixed and the fast
   suite is reliable again. Keep new validation targeted and guarded so one slow
   fixture does not stall the development loop.

2. Real AST Architecture

   Primary plan: [AST Plan](ast-plan.md).

   Move function bodies from raw statement strings to real statement,
   expression, and type AST nodes. This unlocks better errors, fix-its, semantic
   highlighting, LSP quality, native Dudu generics, and structured macros.

3. OOP Surface Cleanup

   Primary plan: [OOP Plan](oop-plan.md).

   Align implementation with the documented surface: `init`, `drop`,
   `static[T]`, no `@staticmethod`, no properties, `@operator(...)`, and static
   access through `Type.name` or `class.name`.

4. Arrays, Matrices, Tensors, And Slicing

   Primary plan: [Arrays, Matrix, Tensor, And Slicing Plan](arrays-indexing-plan.md).

   Migrate current fixed-array syntax to canonical `array[T][shape]`, add
   initializer-based shape inference for `array[T] = literal`, then add
   shape-aware fixed arrays, matrix/tensor indexing, swizzling, and explicit
   view/copy slicing semantics so numeric, graphics, and image code feels
   natural without hidden allocation.

   Status: explicit `array[T][N]` and `array[T][M, N]` compile through the
   string and TypeRef lowering paths, and comma indexing such as `mat[row, col]`
   lowers for Dudu-native fixed arrays. Initializer shape inference, slices,
   swizzling, and library tensor hooks remain.

5. Native Dudu Generics

   Primary plan: [Generics Plan](generics-plan.md).

   Add compile-time generic functions and classes such as `def clamp[T](...)`
   and `class Vec2[T]`, lowering to readable C++ templates and producing
   Dudu-source diagnostics for instantiated errors.

6. Sum Types And Pattern Matching

   Primary plan: [Sum Types And Pattern Matching Plan](sum-types-plan.md).

   Extend simple enums into safe Rust-style tagged unions with payload variants
   and exhaustive `match`. This gives Dudu static heterogeneous data without
   `Any` or silent dynamic containers.

7. Native Inheritance

   Primary plan: [Inheritance Plan](inheritance-plan.md).

   Implement method-only `@abstract`, `@virtual`, `@override`, `super`, current
   class static access, strict multiple inheritance, and interface-like abstract
   classes. Keep imported C++ inheritance behavior generic and header-driven.

8. Macro Surface Prerequisites

   Primary plan: [Macro Syntax Plan](macro-syntax-plan.md).

   Start with target syntax for derives, field attributes, serde-like codegen,
   tests, reflection metadata, binary serialization, and binding generation.
   Prefer AST-backed declaration macros over raw string macros.

9. Native Header Hardening

   Improve overload diagnostics, const/reference modeling, explicit C++
   template calls, template-heavy library behavior, header cache invalidation,
   cache cleanup, and scanner failure UX.

   Status: overload diagnostics, single-`T` explicit template function calls,
   local-header cache invalidation, cache cleanup, broken-Clang diagnostics,
   missing-header diagnostics, and common const pointer/reference lowering are
   implemented. Template-heavy library behavior and deeper overload behavior
   remain the main hardening areas.

10. Real Library Stress Tests

   Keep proving SDL3, ImGui, raylib, glm, sqlite, POSIX, OpenCL, Vulkan, GLFW,
   and FFmpeg style APIs with normal imports and minimal wrapper code.

   Current optional probes pass for glm, OpenCV, sqlite, threading, POSIX mmap,
   POSIX pthread, raylib, SDL3, GLFW, OpenCL, Vulkan, and FFmpeg on this
   machine. Optional dev-only dependencies can be installed into the ignored
   `third_party/install` prefix with `scripts/setup_dev_deps.sh`; the main Dudu
   build does not require them.

11. Incremental Build Strategy

   Move beyond generated-one-file builds where needed. Generate C++ per Dudu
   module so CMake/Ninja can rebuild changed translation units instead of whole
   programs.

   Status: direct native builds preserve generated C++ mtimes and skip the
   C++ compile/link step when the generated C++, native build command, and
   native source inputs are unchanged. True per-module generated C++ remains
   the larger architecture step and is a major requirement for a serious C/C++
   ecosystem-facing toolchain.

12. Language Server And Formatter

   Implement `duc lsp` so editors can show diagnostics, warnings, hover,
   completion, go to definition, find references, rename, formatting, and native
   header navigation. The concrete plan is
   [Language Server Plan](language-server-plan.md).

   Build LSP and formatter behavior from the same AST/sema model used by the
   compiler.

13. Project Driver Polish

   Keep using `dudu` on real projects and fix friction in native build inputs,
   target selection, diagnostics, generated build files, and examples.

14. Freestanding And Embedded Assert Policy

   Hosted `assert` and `debug_assert` are implemented. Freestanding and
   embedded targets reject runtime `assert` instead of accidentally emitting
   hosted runtime machinery.

15. Macro Edge Cases

   Normal imported macros are covered. Keep token-pasting, declaration-
   generating, and partial-syntax macros behind wrapper headers unless a real
   library forces a better design.
